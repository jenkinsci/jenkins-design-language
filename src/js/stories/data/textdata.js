export const hgw = 'No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth ' +
    'century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by ' +
    'intelligences greater than man\'s and yet as mortal as his own; that as ' +
    'men busied themselves about their various concerns they were ' +
    'scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a ' +
    'microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and ' +
    'multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacency men went to ' +
    'and fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their ' +
    'assurance of their empire over matter. It is possible that the ' +
    'infusoria under the microscope do the same. No one gave a thought to ' +
    'the older worlds of space as sources of human danger, or thought of ' +
    'them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or ' +
    'improbable. It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of ' +
    'those departed days. At most terrestrial men fancied there might be ' +
    'other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to ' +
    'welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet across the gulf of space, minds ' +
    'that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, ' +
    'intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with ' +
    'envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. And ' +
    'early in the twentieth century came the great disillusionment.';
